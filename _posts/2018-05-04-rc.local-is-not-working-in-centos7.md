Couple days ago I wrote an article about [MongoDB Enable User Login Authentication](https://www.bulafish.com/centos/2018/04/30/mongodb-enable-authentication/) and in that article, I used rc.local to optimize system environment setting for mongodb at system start up.  But later on I found that rc.local is working as expected cause optimization is not configured after reboot.  So after some research on Google and very soon I found the reason.  Since CentOS7,  
![rc.local](/assets/img/2018050401.png)

It actually explains all, let's check the permission before modification.  Permission is only `644`, no executable permission is given.  
![rc.local](/assets/img/2018050402.png)

{% include ads3.html %}

In order to make rc.local executable, simply run
```bash
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local
```
![rc.local](/assets/img/2018050403.png)

And that's it, reboot your server to confirm if rc.local is running as exepected!
